# My Raspberry installation:<br>How I install my Raspberry Pi?

The goal is to do the installation of a Raspberry Pi step by step.

Please, send me your comments, critics, doubts, requests or sues.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi.
- SD Card (*4 GB or more*).
- Internet access.
- Home network details:
	- One static local IP address (later referred to as *[IP_LAN]*).
	- Default gateway IP. Typically it is the IP address of the router (later referred to as *[IP_Gateway]*).
	- Network mask bits. Typically is '/24' (later referred to as *[Mask_bits]*).
- If you want to connect wireless, you will need also:
	- USB wifi dongle (only if your Raspberry model do not include wireless connectivity.
	- SSID and password (later referred to as *[WIFI_SSID]* and *[WIFI_Password]*).
	- One additional static local IP address (later referred to as *[IP_WLAN]*).

## My hardware

I use the following hardware, so other options might involve slight differences:

- [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)  
- [TP-Link USB WiFi Adapter TL-WN725N](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/tl-wn725n/)

## Steps

1. [Burn Raspberry Pi OS to SD card](#sd).
2. [First startup and configuration](#startup).
3. [OS update and base software installation](#update)
4. [Setup LAN connection](#lan)
5. [Setup WiFi connection](#wifi)
