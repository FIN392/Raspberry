# Raspberry Pi

### Where to begin?

Just jump into my straightforward guide: [How to get your Raspberry Pi up and running](How_to_get_your_Raspberry_Pi_up_and_running.md)

### What's next?

A Raspberry Pi can be used for multiple purposes, but in almost all cases, these are uses that must be run 24x7.

My goal is to provide simple and effective guides for implementing things like:
- File sharing
- Web hosting
- DNS
- VPN
- Network monitoring
- Home Assistant
- Backup
- Media Center
- Print server
- Download manager
- Firewall
