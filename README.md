# My repository of Raspberry stuff

This is a bunch of stuff to be done with a Raspberry Pi. I would recommend following this order:
1. My Raspberry installation. This is how I install my Raspberry Pi. There are many similar step-by-step instructions but this is the good one.

2. telegramMonitoring. It is basic for me, I like to ask Raspberry to do things from my mobile via telegram. Most of the other things have the telegramMonitoring installation as a requirement.

3. ... the rest. Choose what you need.

Please, send me your comments, critics, doubts, requests or sues.
