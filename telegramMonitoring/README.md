# telegramMonitoring: How to mange your Raspberry Pi through Telegram?

The goal is to do a basic management of a Raspberry via telegram.

What can you do?

1. You will get a Telegram message...
- ...each time the Raspberry is started
- ...each time an user log in
- ...each time the Internet connection is recovered after an outage
- ...every 4 hours just to inform that it's still alive

2. You will be able to ask for the following information:
- Last time the Raspberry was down
- Hardware (CPU, memory, disk, USB devices, etc.)
- IP addresses
- CPU and GPU temperature
- How long has it been on
- List of logged in users

3. You will be able of reboot the Raspberry

In addition, you could add more commands (eg: send a photo, print a file, check network devices, etc.)

Please, send me your comments, critics, doubts, requests or sues, as well as any additional command you create

## Requirements

1. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org). It should be up and running with access to Internet (only HTTPS port is required, so it is pretty secure)
2. [Telegram](https://telegram.org). You should have an active Telegram account

## Steps

1. [Create a Telegram bot](#bot)
2. [Installation of '*telegramMonitoring*'](#installation)
3. [Test the commands](#test)
4. [How to add your own bot commands](#more)

## <a name="bot"></a>Create a Telegram bot

Do the following steps from Telegram:
1. Take note of your Telegram ID sending '*/start*' to '*@userinfobot*'. (This data will be referred to later as [Telegram ID])
2. Create bot sending the following '*/*' commands to '*@BotFather*':
- */start*
- */newbot*
	- *{Telegram Botname}_bot*
	- *{Telegram Botname}_bot*
- */setdescription*
	- *@{Telegram Botname}_bot*
	- *Contact @{your Telegram Username} for any information*
- */setcommands*
	- *@{Telegram Botname}_bot*
	- *help - Show available commands*
3. Take note of the bot token sending '*/token*' to '*@BotFather*'. (This data will be referred to later as [Telegram Token])

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation of '*telegramMonitoring*'

Open '*terminal*' (or remote a SSH session) and type the following commnads:
```
rm -r ~/telegramMonitoring
mkdir ~/telegramMonitoring
cd ~/Downloads
rm telegramMonitoring.tar.gz
wget -v https://github.com/FIN392/Raspberry_management_via_Telegram/raw/main/telegramMonitoring.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/telegramMonitoring.tar.gz -C ~/
sudo chmod a+rwx ~/telegramMonitoring
```
Install jq (command-line JSON processor)
```
sudo apt install jq
```
Edit file '*/home/pi/telegramMonitoring/telegramInfo.sh*' and change the Telegram bot token and the Telegram ID for your user
```
sudo nano /home/pi/telegramMonitoring/telegramInfo.sh

    # Token for bot
    telegramToken="[Telegram Token]"

    # ID for Telegram user account
    telegramId="[Telegram ID]"
```
Add the following lines at the beginning of '*crontab*'
```
EDITOR=nano crontab -e

    # telegramMonitoring: Send initial message and start the bot listener
    @reboot (sudo /home/pi/telegramMonitoring/startUp.sh)

    # telegramMonitoring: Check Internet connection every minute
    * * * * * (sudo /home/pi/telegramMonitoring/internetConnection.sh)

    # telegramMonitoring: Send KEEPALIVE message every 4 hours
    0 */4 * * * (sudo /home/pi/telegramMonitoring/stillAlive.sh)
```
Add the following lines at the end of '*/home/pi/.bashrc*'
```
sudo nano /home/pi/.bashrc

    # telegramMonitoring: Log in message
    /home/pi/telegramMonitoring/logIn.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## <a name="test"></a>Test the commands

Reboot the Raspberry. You will get the following messages via telegram:
```
‚ú®
Raspberry started!

üëç
Listener is ON. Use /help to see the available commands
```
Send '*/help*' to the bot, you will get the list of available commands:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è
Available commands:
Show this help                 : /help
List of last downtime periods  : /downtime
Show hardware                  : /hardware
Show active IPs                : /ip
Reboot NOW                     : /reboot
Show CPU and GPU temperature   : /temperature
Shows the time up              : /uptime
List of logged in users        : /users
```
Send the different commands and check the results

## <a name="more"></a>How to add your own bot commands

To add more commands just add a new script in the directory '*~/telegramMonitoring/botCommands*'

The script should follow this tempate:
```
#!/bin/bash

#HELP: {Brief description of 30 characters or less for the '/help' command}

echo "%E2%9A%99" # 'UTF-8 Hex Bytes' code of any icon (https://www.iemoji.com/)

#
# Add here your commands
# The output of the script will be send by Telegram
# The message is sent using a monospaced font, so you can format the output as you like
#
```
Be sure to secure the script with:
```sudo chmod a+wrx ~/telegramMonitoring/botCommands/{script name}.sh```
